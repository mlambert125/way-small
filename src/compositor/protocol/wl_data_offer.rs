//! `wl_data_offer` protocol handler.
//!
//! An offer is the compositor's name for a `wl_data_source` belonging to some
//! other client, handed to a client that may read from it — the clipboard, or
//! the content of a drag passing over one of its surfaces.
//!
//! The id is the compositor's rather than the client's, which has a consequence
//! worth keeping in mind throughout this file: `wl_display.delete_id` is never
//! sent for a server id, so nothing but the client's own `destroy` takes the id
//! out of its object map. When the compositor stops caring about an offer — the
//! clipboard has been replaced, the drag has left the window — it forgets the
//! offer's *contents* and keeps its *identity*. Every request here therefore
//! has to survive its backing [`DataOffer`] having gone.
