//! `wl_data_source` protocol handler.
//!
//! A data source is a list of mime types a client says it can produce, offered
//! either as the clipboard or as the content of a drag. It holds no data: what
//! moves the bytes is a pipe the two clients share, and this interface's
//! `send` event is where the compositor hands one end across.
