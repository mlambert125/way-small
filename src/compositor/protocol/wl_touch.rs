//! `wl_touch` protocol handler.
//!
//! Touch is multi-point: several fingers are down at once and every event names
//! which one it is about. A point belongs to the surface it *started* on for
//! its whole life, so a finger dragged off a window keeps reporting to the
//! client that owns it — which is what makes a swipe that leaves the window
//! still reach the thing being swiped.
