//! `wl_data_device` protocol handler.
//!
//! A data device is where a client is told two things: what the clipboard
//! holds, and what is being dragged over its surfaces. It is per-seat, and
//! since there is one seat here, per-client in practice — though a client may
//! hold more than one, and each is told separately.
//!
//! The clipboard follows keyboard focus. There is one selection at a time, and
//! the client that has focus is the one told about it.
