//! `wl_fixes` protocol handler.
//!
//! One global for problems in the core protocol that could not be fixed where
//! they arose. It carries a single repair so far: a way to destroy a
//! `wl_registry`.
//!
//! `wl_registry` has no `destroy` request of its own, which is an oversight
//! rather than a design — a client that binds a registry can never give it
//! back, so the compositor keeps sending it `global` and `global_remove` for
//! the life of the connection and the id is never freed. `destroy_registry`
//! is the way out, and it has to live on a separate interface because adding
//! a request to `wl_registry` would have changed a version every client
//! already depends on.
